## Description
Project that combines several technologies to create a robust web application. It uses Vite for frontend development, Express for the backend, and several libraries for media manipulation and API calls.

## Functionalities
- **Frontend**: Uses Vite for bundling and rapid development.
- **Backend**: Implemented with Express, a minimalist framework for Node.js web applications.
- **Transformers**: Integration with the `@xenova/transformers` library for natural language processing tasks.
- **Media Manipulation**: Uses `ffmpeg-static` and `fluent-ffmpeg` to manipulate audio and video files.
- **Video Download**: Uses `ytdl-core` to download videos from YouTube.
- **API Calls**: `axios` to make HTTP calls.
- **Audio Manipulation**: `node-wav` for reading and manipulating WAV files.
- **CORS**: Configured with `cors` to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
